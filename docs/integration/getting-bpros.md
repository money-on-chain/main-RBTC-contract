# Getting BPros

In this tutorial we will show you how to get BitPro tokens.

The BitPro, as you may already know, is an _ERC20_ token.(If you didn't, and you don't know what is exactly an _ERC20_ token [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md) is a full explanation of it).
​
This means that most wallets like Nifty and MetaMask can handle them if you tell them to ([MetaMask tutorial on how to do it](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031-How-to-View-Your-Tokens), Nifty is very similar to it so you should follow that link too if you are using the latter).
​
That BitPro is an _ERC20_ Token also means that any user that has already some tokens can trade them to you in exchange for a service or for another token.
​
But in some circumstances you may not find such a user. In those cases, you may be happy to know that you can create them(or mint them, as it is usually said) using the Smart Contracts.
