# Introduction

Money On Chain is a suite of smart contracts dedicated to providing a bitcoin-collateralized stable-coin, Dollar On Chain, (DoC) and a passive income hodler-targeted token, BitPro (BPRO).

The rationale behind this is that deposits of Rootstock-BTC (RBTC) help collateralize the DoCs, BitPro absorbs the USD-BTC rate fluctuations.
