# Introduction

Money On Chain is a suite of smart contracts dedicated to providing a bitcoin-collateralized stable-coin, Dollar On Chain, (DoC); a passive income hodler-targeted token, BitPro (BPRO), and a leveraged Bitcoin investment instrument (BTCX series).

The rationale behind this is that deposits of Rootstock-BTC (RBTC) help collateralize the DoCs, BitPro absorbs the USD-BTC rate fluctuations, and BTC2X is leveraged borrowing value from BitPro and DoC holders, with a daily interest rate being paid to the former.
